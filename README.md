# mkvid

This is a project to allow one to create videos
with moving text, images and geometrical figures.
It is essentially a bit of a [manim][] clone, 
but more inspired by "PowerPoint animations" à la [Vhèkkyo Boy][].

Unlike other projects such as `lut` and `bocproc`,
this is not a scripting language, but an actual library 
that's meant to integrate with the rest of Common Lisp.

# Concept
A video contains a number of scenes, with a number of actors
that can move around, grow, shrink or otherwise transform.
